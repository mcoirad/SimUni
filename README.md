# Higher Ed Simulator 2.0
##### Direct an educational institution from the hippie-dippie days of the early 70s to the market-driven present!

This is my attempt to build a not-so-serious game depicting the management and growth of an institution of higher education. The plan is to combine a fairly detailed mathematical model with the tacky aesthetic you can find in university admissions booklets and advertisements. Its based on research focusing in large part on the history of the New College of Florida, with as much creative embellishment as possible.

## Planned Features

  - Compete with other regional institutions to attract the best students!
  - Attempt to please your rich, conservative donors to attract funding without angering your independent-minded students!
  - Expand your academic offerings to keep pace with information age while avoiding financial ruin!
  - When you finally go bankrupt, sell your school to the state university system!
  - Try not to go bankrupt again when the state cuts funding for public education!
  - Hire architects to design your dorms specifically to prevent students from rioting!
  - Reduce funding to faculty to pay for more athletics!
  - etc.
